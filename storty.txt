This is the frist project of CS400, this repository is created by Charles. And as a front end developter for this project, I have 
make a driver class, MadisonBuffetDriver.java, for this project and it should work as long as there is a hashtable and MadisonBuffet class
which I also upload a dummie MadisonBuffet class so that the driver class can work.

Charles put countless hours of work and dedication into this project, staying up long into the night, functioning on caffeine and sheer determination.
  Beginning the long and treacherous journey, Charles prepared himself with a long nights sleep, to keep his brain functioning at maximum capacity for
  as long as possible. He awoke and brewed his first, but definitely not his last, pot of coffee. Opening his laptop with the gaze of a cheetah nearing a
  gazelle, the keys of the laptop began to clack. His fingers danced to the hypnotic rhythm as seconds turned to minutes turned to hours. 

Charlese is always the one works the hardest. Meanwhile, he is willing to help others with their work. He knows success without hard work is not possible.
Someone who is waiting for a wonderful oppotunity coming by itself will never gain anything. Otherwise, the person who is working hard is able to succeed 
and gain happiness in life. Take an exampple, the famous president Abraham Lincoln was born in poor family. 
He could not afford a lamp and read borrowed books with the light of the fire in the hearth. And yet by dint of hard work, he rose to be the greatest man of his time.
